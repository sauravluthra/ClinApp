# ClinApp
The stand-alone clinician app that will be used alongside the patient device. ENGG41xx Final Project.

Languages: Python, C/C++

This software may:

    1. Store an encrypted (compliant with HIPAA and PIPEDA) patient file containing body measurements and personal information. The file will also have a unique device ID that is matched with the device ID on the patient's embedded device.

    2. Download, store, and verify the data recordings from the patient device.

    3. Filter and interpret the fixed time-series data stored in numerous ways, determined by the team.

    4. Present useful metrics deduced from the data, graphical and 3D visualizations, suspected patient conditions, and any other information that a clinician may deem useful in diagnosing the cause of a patient's persistent back pain.

    5. Require an authorized user ID and password from a clinician to login and view patient information/data/diagnoses.
